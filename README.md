Cloudflare (Link) is a pretty awesome way to speed up your site through their optimization and caching.  

They also keep a blacklist of abusive hosts and block them from accessing your site, be it botnet zombies, or spammers, etc etc.  

They have a feature where you can "scramble" all email addresses listed on your site to keep them hidden from email harvesting bots, which is pretty useful, especially for forums to give your users a little more protection when sharing info with each other, or having their emails listed in their profile (Tsk tsk.. forum software should scramble that stuff anyways, but a lot of them don't).
